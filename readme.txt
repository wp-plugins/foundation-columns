Use the Zurb Foundation-grid and block grid in all your posts, pages and custom post types.

== Description ==

Adds support for using Zurb's Foundation grid-system via shortcodes in WordPress' TinyMCE editor.

For more information about Foundation, please [read the docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/ "Zurb Foundation").

This plugin is compatible with version 5 of Foundation, and includes support for small, medium and large breakpoints.

Now also with support for block grids.

Please note: This plugin does not install Foundation for you and therefore require that you use a theme built on Foundation.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `foundation-columns` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Have fun using Foundation in the TinyMCE-editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the grid? =

Simply highlight a section of text in your Visual Editor while creating a new or editing a page and click the "Zurb"-icon in the editor's toolbar. Follow the steps and the shortcodes should be inserted around your selected text.

= I don't want small and medium, just the large breakpoint. How do I do it? =

If you don't want all the breakpoints you can just click "OK" while prompted for a number. This will tell the plugin to skip adding those breakpoints.

= Text that I don't put in columns are not aligned with rest of the site. =

Foundation Columns adds a row to posts where the shortcode is detected. I recommend you put all your content in columns to make sure it gets the right padding.

== Screenshots ==
